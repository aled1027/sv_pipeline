"""
PathLinker finds high-scoring paths that connect a source node set to a
target node set in a large, optionally weighted directed network.  To
reconstruct signaling pathways, PathLinker returns high-scoring paths
from any receptor protein (source node) to any transcriptional regulator
(target node) in a protein-protein interactome.

REQUIRED arguments:
    NETWORK - A tab-delimited file with one directed interaction per
        line. Each line should have at least 2 columns: tail, head. Edges
        are directed from tail to head. This file can have a third column
        specifying the edge weight, which is required unless the --PageRank
        option is used (see --PageRank help for a note on these weights).
        To run PathLinker on an unweighted graph, set all edge weights
        to 1 in the input network.

    NODE_TYPES - A tab-delimited file denoting nodes as receptors or TRs. The first
        column is the node name, the second is the node type, either 'source'
        (or 'receptor') or 'target' (or 'tr' or 'tf'). Nodes which are neither receptors nor TRs may
        be omitted from this file or may be given a type which is neither 'source'
        nor 'target'.
